/**
 * Implementation of the Drawable interface associates a drawable
 * object with a Renderer to use for drawing.  In addition, this
 * class specifies some features useful for elements in a 
 * 2d video game.
 * <p>
 * Every element has an
 * "exact" position represented by an (x, y) pair of floating-point values.
 * This position is the upper-left corner of a bounding rectangle whose
 * width and height are additional attributes. Other attributes include
 * a frame counter and a flag that allows an application to "mark" an
 * object for subsequent deletion. A key operation is the <code>update</code>
 * method, which an application would normally call each frame. At a minimum
 * the <code>update</code> method should increment the frame count, but 
 * more generally, subclasses would override the method to implement
 * features such as movement.
